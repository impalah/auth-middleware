# auth-middleware

Async Auth Middleware for FastAPI/Starlette.

## Technology Stack:

- FastAPI
- Pytest (\*)

## Development environment

### Requirements:

- Python >= 3.12 (Pyenv, best option)
- Poetry as dependency manager

### Activate development environment

```
poetry install
```

This will create a new virtual environment (if it does not exists) and will install all the dependencies.

To activate the virtual environment use:

```
poetry shell
```

### Add/remove dependencies

```
poetry add PIP_PACKAGE [-G group.name]
```

Add dependency to the given group. If not specified will be added to the default group.

```
poetry remove PIP_PACKAGE [-G group.name]
```

Remove dependency from the given group

## Tests

### Debug From VS Code

Get the path of the virtual environment created by poetry:

```bash
poetry env info -p
```

Set in visual studio code the default interpreter to the virtual environment created by poetry.(SHIT+CTRL+P Select interpreter)

Launch "Pytest launch" from the run/debug tab.

You can set breakpoints and inspections

### Launch tests from command line

```
poetry run pytest --cov-report term-missing --cov=web_api_template ./tests
```

This will launch tests and creates a code coverage report.

### Exclude code from coverage

When you need to exclude code from the code coverage report set, in the lines or function to be excluded, the line:

```
# pragma: no cover
```
